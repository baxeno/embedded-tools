# baxeno/embedded-tools

This container shows how to create a build environment that can be used both by CI servers and developers.
Developers would normally use `docker_workspace.sh` to bootstrap all needed docker parameters or alternative use YAML with docker-compose.
CI servers normally don't like entry-point scripts so disable it with `--entrypoint=''`.

Default seccomp can block needed system calls, so it can be handy to test with `--security-opt seccomp:unconfined`.

> :warning: Create custom seccomp profile. See [Docker secure computing mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/).

:unicorn: Fairy tale
---

Once upon a time Acme Corporation had a big problem with unicorn build environments.
They shipped everything from bird seeds to explosive tennis balls.
Customers loved their products which meant Acme was producing 7 different versions of anvils.
This poses a challenge since 2 are round, 4 are square and 1 is hexagon so it required
3 build environments just for anvils :hammer:.

Jenkins declarative pipelines

Example of using this docker container can be seen in [example/Jenkinsfile](example/Jenkinsfile).

**Private docker registry:**

Add `registryUrl` and `registryCredentialsId` properties under `pipeline.agent.docker` in the `Jenkinsfile`.
